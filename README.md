A just-for-fun functional Scala implementation of a singly linked list.

I've done my best to implement the most useful APIs from the built in Scala
[scala.collection.immutable.List](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/immutable/List.html)
implementation from first principles, without referring to `List`'s source code.

You should stick with `List` for production code; this repo is just for fun. :)
